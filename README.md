# Linear_Regression

## About the Project

The Linear_Regression project is an educational tool designed to provide hands-on experience with linear regression analysis using Python 3. This project stands out by generating its own random dataset, which is then used to demonstrate the principles and application of linear regression. It includes a custom-built Linear Regression class, specifically written for this project to facilitate an in-depth understanding of the underlying mechanics.

## Dataset

The project script dynamically generates a random dataset for analysis. This approach allows users to understand how linear regression can be applied to different sets of data and how variations in data can affect the outcomes of the regression model.

## Technical Requirements

 - Python 3
 - Additional Python libraries as specified in requirements.txt

## Installation

 - Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
 - Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
 - Navigate to the project directory and run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install the necessary Python libraries.

## Usage

 - Open Jupyter Notebook in the directory containing the project files.
 - Locate and open the Linear_Regression_Presentation.ipynb notebook.
 - Run the cells in the notebook to see the linear regression analysis in action. The notebook makes use of the custom Linear Regression class module included in the project.

## Output

The notebook provides visualizations of the linear regression process and outcomes. These visualizations include:
 - Scatter plots of the generated dataset.
 - Plots showing the best fit line as determined by the linear regression.
 - Any additional metrics or visualizations that help in understanding the regression model's performance.
